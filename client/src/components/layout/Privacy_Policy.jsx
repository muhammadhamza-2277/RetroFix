                Embedded content from other websites
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
                Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has
                visited the other website.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
                tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your
                interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
                website.

            <Typography paragraph>
                If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so
                we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in
                a moderation queue.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information
                at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see
                and edit that information.

                exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided
                to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
                include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
